Our current idea is our first prototype from milestone1 (platform for freelancers), but narrowed down to just piano instructors (since none of us are piano instructors). The app will include features specific to private piano instruction, such as repertoires, pricing, and piano types.

Since we narrowed down our idea from general freelancing to just piano instructors, the first page for creating an instructor profile (instructor_start.html) is now a form for the users name and years of experience, instead of a form for selecting the category of work. The last instructor profile creation page (instructor_detail.html), will now be for the instructors details and repertoire. We also added a login page.
