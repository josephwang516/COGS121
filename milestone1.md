Project Proposal #1 - Freelance Practitioner Networking Platform
Our first idea is a platform for freelance practitioners of various trades and crafts to advertise themselves, get connected with customers, and build experience. Users fall into two groups - vendors and customers. Vendors are independent practitioners who want to advertise their work and find customers. Examples of vendors are home barbers, music instructors, tutors, and personal trainers. Customers are people who are looking for these services. Although our group members could fall into the customers category, the main target user population for this app is vendors, which none of us are. Independent practitioners have limited ways to advertise their work, often being limited to social media and word of mouth. Our app aims to give these practitioners another platform to connect with potential customers.  
Possible APIs: Maps/Google Maps


Project Proposal #2 - Elderly and the Senior Population
Our second idea is to target the elderly population, and develop a platform specifically to meet their needs and demands through the use of technology in a web application. This can take on the form of a networking app to connect the elderly population with volunteers and/or assistants to help the elderly in many of their day to day errands, such as shopping, exercising, etc. Frequently, elderly may have trouble or be unable to perform important tasks to maintain their normal livelihood as they encounter physical and/or psychological difficulties due to age. We aim to meet this need by providing a group of people willing to provide personal, on-demand, and readily available help so that this target population will be able to continue living their lives normally.

None of our team members fall within the target population because all the members of our team are under the age of 65.
Possible APIs: Maps/Google Maps, Yelp Fusion
